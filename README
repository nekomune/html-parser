A project inspired by jq

Did it to study basic lexical analysis, a springboard to using the proper lexer
tools out there, yet somehow not a single lexeme was used in this program. Har.

If I come back to this program I'd like to add programmable filters.

Tags should keep track of their parents in order to append missing content
(especially from void elements)

In the far future I could consider making a proper DOM extractor of my own.
